# Direction finding code
This is a set of codes used for finding the direction of a burst in the *LAXPC* sky. The codes are written in `Python` and use the `Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib and Astropy` libraries. There are four folders currently, which are used to store various parts related to the code. In order to get a running version, the **src** folder will suffice.

The four folders in the repo. are

 1. **src** : contains the source code.
 2. **legacy** : contains old / deprecated code and a few bits of test code. this folder is mainly to keep a track of the pre-git era.
 3. **report** : contains the tex files and images which act as a report for the codes.
 4. **refs** : contains links to useful reference files.

The main code is **src/getdirn.py**. This will be used to comute the probable direction of the burst. **src/plotdirn.py** plots the *LAXPC* sky and can be tweaked for making nice images.
